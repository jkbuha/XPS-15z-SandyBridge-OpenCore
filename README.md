# Overview

This is a great sturdy machine that was previously running Sierra (10.12) on Clover and has now been upgraded with a 2TB SATA 
and transitioned to Monterey. Given that the UEFI and ACPI specification on this machine was incomplete it was necessary to 
attach a fully working and modified DSDT together with some Monterey-specific tweaks. The only thing that doesn't seem to work 
is Continuity/Handoff, due to the BLE 5.0 minimum specification which the wireless adapter doesn't (yet?) support. Other than 
that it works perfectly, with idle temps of 45C and no fan noise throughout.

# BIOS Settings

# Display EDID override
Some of the 15x (L502x) and 15z (L511z) machines experience display lock-up under macOS (the display freezes after 1 min 
of use and only the cursor moves) due to a framebuffer misalignment with the EDID settings. To overcome this it is necessary to 
force a display override with a specific EDID monitor file in /System/Library/Displays/Contents/Resources/Overrides - in my 
case it's DisplayVendor-6af but it will be specific to your LVDS vendor.
